# Learning Spring Boot: N-Tier Architecture Project

Welcome to the repository of my learning project for Spring Boot, where I explore advanced concepts like N-tier architecture and Exception Handling. As a student in Spring Boot development, this project serves as a practical exploration of best practices in backend application design.

## Project Objectives:

- **Hands-on Learning:** This project is a result of my journey to understand and implement N-tier architecture and effective Exception Handling in a Spring Boot application.

- **Student Perspective:** As a student in Spring Boot development, I've structured this project to reflect the learning process, with emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and educational value.

- **Modularization:** I've taken a modular approach to design, making it easier to comprehend and navigate through the various components of the backend.

## Key Features:

- **N-Tier Architecture:** Embracing a structured N-tier architecture to gain insights into the separation of concerns and scalable design patterns.

- **Exception Handling:** Implementing robust exception handling to ensure the application gracefully handles errors and provides a smooth user experience.

- **Scalable Backend:** Designing the architecture with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and additional features.

## Technologies Used:

- **Spring Boot:** Leveraging the power of Spring Boot for building Java-based enterprise applications.
  
- **Java:** Emphasizing the use of Java as the primary language to reinforce object-oriented principles.
  
-**Lombok** Removing excessive code syntax using this plugin to increase readablity.
